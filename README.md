# BigNumber

Building on Limeoats' bignumber library for portability and C++17 features. Mainly just experimenting for now, really. I can't emphasize enough that Limeoats is the original author of this library, and while I am using his source to experiment and perhaps build on, the credit for the original implementation wholly and rightly belongs to him.

Original Author: [Limeoats](https://github.com/Limeoats)

## Documentation

The doc directory contains the necessary files to generate the documentation using Doxypress. I will be actually including the documentation in a later release; I'm ignoring the directory for now to speed up development push/pulls from remote repo.
